# Erstellen von Abfragen

Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Query Service] provides the power to run SQL queries against datasets in the [!DNL Data Lake] within [!DNL Experience Platform]. As you use SQL to interact with datasets in the Data Lake, it is important to understand that [!DNL Query Service] automatically manages certain aspects, such as creating SQL-safe table names for each dataset in the [!DNL Data Lake]. There are also considerations around working with hierarchical data in the [!DNL Data Lake], including discovering the schema upon which a dataset is based and ensuring that you are selecting the correct field within the hierarchical model.

The following documentation will help you to better understand core concepts within [!DNL Query Service]:
